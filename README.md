Hello stranger.
This is a theme for BetterDiscord designed to give Comic Sans font to discord.


To install, place Font.theme.css to %APPDATA%\betterdiscord\themes > Discord > Settings > Themes > Comic Sans Font v(VERSION) by @Nostalgia#5187 > "Enable Switch" Toggle on.
This is to not be on sale, as it is open sourse. If I find my theme on your site for $$$, I will gladly take it down. If it's free and credits this Github, I'm perfectly fine with it.

So if your confused, I named this Determination Mono, because I thought it was handwriting, but actually no, but Comic Sans. I found this out when I changed my Windows font to Comic Sans. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80448295/113499368-609ae280-94ca-11eb-919b-a09f99670d7b.png)
