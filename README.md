Hello, thanks for downloading Font.theme.css.
This is a theme for BetterDiscord designed to give determination mono font.


To install, place Font.theme.css to %APPDATA%\betterdiscord\themes > Discord > Settings > Themes > Determination Mono Font v(VERSION) by @Nostalgia#5187 > "Enable Switch" Toggle on.
This is to not be on sale, as it is open sourse. If I find my theme on your site for $$$, I will gladly take it down.
