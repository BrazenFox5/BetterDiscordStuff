# BetterDiscord_ThemesPlugins
Hello fellow stranger! So this is where I store BBD Themes & Plugins.
Please note that I am only 14 and only know the basics of *.css, so I barely know how to do a *.js which is used for BBD plugins.
# Follow the below please
1. Don't put my shit on your site etc. and sell it for money, otherwise I will ask to put it down or I might use legal actions. The only way I will support putting stuff on your site is if it credits the github that the theme/plugin was located and is free.
2. Don't share this to a friend and say on how "you made it." This hurts me as I put effort into my shit.
