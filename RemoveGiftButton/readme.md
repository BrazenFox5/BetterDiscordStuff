# RemoveGiftButton
Hello there! This theme is used to remove the "gift" button in the text areas in server channels or DMs.
The feature of the Gift button is to gift a random friend nitro, but the button gets in the way.

# Changelog
*(v0.9.2)*
At first, I was attempting to make the a ^.plugin.js until Gibbu themself told me what I was trying to do was ^.css, so yeah, enjoy an ^.theme.css
*(0.9.1)*
Visual Studio Code didn't save the file even after I used the shortcut of *Ctrl + S*. So everything is just scrap.
